"""
Embeds data and comment into the page, after checking the data. Called by
lovable/build.py, which has already inlined the styles and the chart; the
result is a single self-contained HTML file.

The page has to open without an internet connection and make no network request
of any kind: no fonts, no libraries, no analytics. So the styles and the chart
script are inline, the palette is a :root block in the page, and the dataset is
placed in a <script type="application/json"> inside the file itself.

Updating the data does not go through this script: the CSV is loaded in the
browser, recalculated in place, and the page hands back a new file just as
self-contained as this one. The script is for the first build and for rebuilding
after a change to the markup.
