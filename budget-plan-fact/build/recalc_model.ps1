# Recalculates the Excel model with the live engine and verifies the result.
#
# openpyxl only writes formulas. What they actually compute is shown only by
# real Excel: in the first artefact that is how a "Total" referring to itself
# and a scalar median were found. Without this step the file holds no computed
# value at all, and "agrees to the cent" is backed by nothing.
#
# It does three things:
#   1. CalculateFullRebuild + Save — values appear in the workbook;
#   2. looks for formula errors (#REF!, #VALUE!, #DIV/0! and the rest);
#   3. reconciles the totals against budget-plan-fact.csv and fails on a mismatch.
