 *
 * Plain ES2020. No import/export, no access to document/window, no external

 *
 * Public interface:
 *   CALC.generateDemoData()           → Employee[]   (~200, deterministic)
 *   CALC.analyse(employees, settings) → Result
 *   CALC.selfCheck(result)            → CheckResult
 *
 * Conventions:
 *   - money is a number in roubles and kopecks, rounded only for display;
 *   - percentages are numbers like 8.4, not 0.084;
 *   - "actual" money accounts for fte and months worked;
 *     "normalised" money is the full-year equivalent;
 *   - analyse() does not mutate the array it is given.
 *
 * Order of computation:
 *   normalisation → gap → OLS decomposition → recipients → two scenarios →
 *   contributions → conversion back to actual money → annual effect.

   * than a man". A positive gap favours
   * men, a negative one favours women.
   *
   * explained: the difference the regression predicts from differences in
   * grade/tenure:
   *   explained_RUB = coef_grade × (mean_grade_M − mean_grade_F)
   *                 + coef_tenure × (mean_tenure_M − mean_tenure_F)
   * That is, "how much of the gap is explained by men being on average in
   * higher grades and with longer service". Expressed as % of mean_M.
   *
   * unexplained_pct = raw_gap_mean_pct − explained_pct. Only this part is
   * adjusted.
   *
   * explained is clamped to [0, raw_gap] when the gap is positive: a negative
   * explained part would mean the grade structure works IN FAVOUR of women, and
   * subtracting it would inflate the residual above the actual gap — the model
   * would then demand raising women above men.
   * A DECISION BEYOND THE SPEC, noted in the report.

   * larger the share of the budget they receive. This is the only method;
   * alternatives are out of scope.
   *
   * How much has to be distributed in total: enough to bring the category's
   * unexplained residual down from its current level to the target. The
   * residual is measured as a % of men's average pay, so the amount needed in
   * (normalised) roubles is:
   *   need_RUB = (unexplained_pct − target_pct) / 100 × mean_M × n_F
   * where n_F is the headcount of the underpaid gender: raising women's average
   * pay by ΔRUB requires ΔRUB × n_F roubles of payroll.
